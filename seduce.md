### Introduction

SeDuCe is a CPER research project that aims at building a scientific testbed to enable the study of both thermal and power management aspects in datacenters. The testbed is hosted at the [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) campus located in Nantes.

### In short

- 48 servers located in airtights racks and integrated in [Grid'5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/Grid5000:Home) (_ecotype_ cluster)
- Power consumption of each server is monitored
- Temperature at the front and the back of each server is monitored
- More than 200 sensors probe is collected every second
- A [Dashboard](https://seduce.fr) that eases the visualization of data
- An [API](https://api.seduce.fr) that enables to integrate data and third party scripts
- _(In Progress)_ Integration of renewable energy in the testbed (solar panels + batteries)
